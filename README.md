Sparta is a smart bot that performs automatic tasks, just like a human does. When doing a lot of tasks, the human mind can't remember everything, so
you may need it for some tasks that are repetetive and annoying.

# questions :

1 - do I need this bot? (A)

A - For some people, yes. For others, no. The entire reason this bot exists is to complete tedious tasks.


2 - Can this bot Work 24/7? (B)

B - Yes, you can use VPS or keep your computer on. Though, I recommended Using VPS.


3 - Does this robot work on Mac? (C)

C - Yes, but it's harder to run it on Mac. The reason is how different operating systems work. Macintosh can't run exe files, unlike Windows, which is what Sparta was designed and tested on. There are solutions though: you could follow this tutorial on how to open exes https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-open-exe-files-on-mac, or the bot could be exported as a dmg file. Don't expect much on Mac though, since there is no support and we have little to no experience on Mac and developing Mac applications, this would be incredibly difficult.


4 - Can I use this robot on my phone? (D)

D - No, it isn't possible to run exe files on the Phone. Sparta was designed on Windows, and will not come to mobile devices.


5 - Does it get better each update? (E)

E - Yes, every update makes Sparta better. In updates, we fix bugs, add features, automated tasks, and bots into Sparta.


6 - Can this robot think or understand? (F)

F - No, Sparta is just a robot doing automatic tasks that you tell it to do.


8 - Can I help with this Project? (H)

H - Yes, You can send suggestions or messaging me for bugs that need to be fixed.
